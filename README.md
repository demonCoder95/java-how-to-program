# Java - How to Program
This repository contains the in-chapter code samples as well as solutions to some exercises for the Java - How to Program text book by Dietel & Dietel.

Find all the source code, sorted by chapters in the `src/main/java` directory. Most of it is `Class.java` and `ClassTest.java` files. The `Class.java` file
will contain the source code of the class and the `ClassTest.java` file will have the driver program to test that class.
